### Testing of stock retrieval functionality

*   Use IndexController -> /api/v1/stock/ GET API with passing stockTicker = AA

<img src="Screenshots\getByStock_API.png"/>

*   Verify response has 25 elements as it returns both 1 and 2 quarters AA stock

*   Try with stockTicker which does not exists -> it should return empty list

### Testing of single record insertion functionality

*   Use IndexController -> /api/v1/stock/ POST API with payload json as below
